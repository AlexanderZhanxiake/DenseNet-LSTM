# DenseNet + LSTM Architecture #

This is a basic implementation of DenseNet combined with LSTM, used for sequence modeling. 
Here, DenseNet is a CNN feature extractor that feeds the extracted features to LSTM network in sequence. The network predicts 4 corner landmarks of each image in sequence. Overall, its a regression network for image with CNN feature extractor and basic LSTM layer.
